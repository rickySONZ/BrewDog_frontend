# BrewDog Front End

Back end repository is hosted on this link https://github.com/rickySONZ/BrewDog_backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

To launch run ```npm start``` or ```yarn start```
Devices running with an Apple M1 Chip may have to run ```env FAST_REFRESH=false npm start``` in order to run properly as there is current a compatiblity issue with Create-React-App.
